# Northstar Quant

A personal futures research application: import minute bars, replay a strategy
with Risk and trading costs, and inspect persistent results in your browser.
One repository, one Python package, one PostgreSQL database.

## Run

```sh
docker compose up --build -d
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:18080>. The browser and database bind to local loopback;
the Compose credentials are local development credentials. `docker compose down`
stops the application and keeps its data volume.

The workspace imports a bounded CSV with explicit contract and session metadata,
runs the entire observation sequence and shows the saved equity curve, fills,
costs, holdings and risk decisions. Empty state contains no invented results.

## Command line

With Python 3.12, `uv`, and PostgreSQL 17:

```sh
uv sync --locked
export NORTHSTAR_DATABASE_URL='postgresql+psycopg://northstar:northstar_local@127.0.0.1:15432/northstar_quant'
uv run northstar init-db
uv run northstar run examples/intraday.toml
uv run northstar list
uv run northstar serve
```

`northstar show RUN_ID` reads a persisted result; `northstar replay RUN_ID`
uses its fixed snapshot and full saved configuration. The input file path is
relative to the study TOML, not the shell directory. The example is explicitly
synthetic and demonstrates the working application; it is not market evidence.

Research parameters have explicit defaults and reject unknown fields. Money,
prices and ratios are decimal strings; counts are integers. The application
derives contract identity, price economics, simulated positions, equity and mark
prices from the accepted data and execution ledger.

CSV columns are exactly `event_time,available_at,source_record_id,open,high,low,close,volume`.
`event_time` is the minute's start. `available_at` must be at or after its
completion and must truthfully represent historical availability. Prices and
volumes are plain decimals; every price must align to the declared tick. The
explicit session determines expected coverage; the file cannot define its own
quality expectations by omitting missing bars.

## Model scope

The current simulation uses one contract and one explicit intraday session of
one-minute bars. A completed bar becomes available at its supplied availability
time. Existing authorizations may fill at a subsequent observed close, adjusted
by declared tick slippage, before the next strategy decision. Per-lot fees are
actually deducted; Risk bounds and account constraints apply to execution.

Results report realized and unrealized PnL, remaining exposure, fees, equity and
drawdown. They do not assume a final liquidation, exchange settlement, partial
fills or market impact. The strategy is a baseline momentum direction with a
deadband and explicit target exposure, not a profitability claim. There is no
annualized Sharpe inferred from a single session, live data feed or broker link.

Accepted input snapshots and results are immutable. A run records its full
configuration, snapshot identity and an implementation fingerprint of source,
dependency lock, Python runtime and actual installed runtime dependencies.
Reproducing a run requires those exact inputs and the current implementation.
This greenfield application has neither backward nor forward compatibility.

## Development

`make verify` runs the checks that protect implemented behavior.
`NORTHSTAR_TEST_DATABASE_URL` must point to a disposable PostgreSQL database named
`northstar_quant_test`; tests replace its data. Never point tests at application
data. `uv build` produces one installable application wheel with its current
migrations and dependency-lock identity.

CI also installs the wheel with locked runtime dependencies in a separate
environment and exercises the installed CLI and HTTP application from an empty
working directory. It checks the synthetic study's accounting, repeated runs,
exact replay, packaged web assets and persistence across application restarts.
The same check runs inside the runtime-only Docker image, without a source mount:
`python scripts/check_install.py examples/intraday.toml` (use the installed
environment's Python and the disposable test database). This is a real HTTP
check; it does not replace browser interaction acceptance.

Detailed behavior lives in code. [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) explains
the organization and assumptions; [development order](docs/ROADMAP.md) explains
the stages. [GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/isqiwen/projects/1) tracks
the issues, priorities and dependencies. [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) contains the
permanent engineering rules: current-only design, flexible topology, vertical delivery, cohesive code
and a small behavior-focused test budget.
